    <p>Nestled in the serene setting of a beautiful countryside, Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS), is home to an extraordinarily proficient student body which has helped PIEAS to be more than just an academically strong university.
        This year the entire student body of PIEAS came together one more time for the advent of the truly magnificent PiON’19, to convey the crisp magic of autumn in an even better way. This event, being the fifth installment of its kind, scales bigger
        with the advent of various new modules, a more creative, cohesive and dedicated host team and an audience eager to witness some extraordinary technical and non-technical skills.</p>
    <p>This captivating event will attract students from all over the country, providing them a platform to not only sharpen their skills but also grow, learn and interact with professionals in their respective fields. It is an ideal opportunity for the
        youth to utilize their growing energy constructively and showcase their talents. The organizers intend to make this PiON better in all possible aspects than the previous one. The planning of all modules have been properly thought out. These modules
        will stretch from technical to non-technical areas promising an event bigger and better than the previous ones.</p>
    <p>Let’s mark this autumn as a beginning of new competitive and creative spirit amongst one and all.</p>
