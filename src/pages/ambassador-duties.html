    <h1>Ambassador Duties</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Ambassadors are selected among a huge number of applicants based on their experience and passion. They represent their institute with the responsibility to ensure maximum registration. They may take the Student Activities Committee of their institute
            into confidence, forwarding them the invites and asking to arrange transport (and other facilities if required) for them. However, if their request is not facilitated, PiON ’19 team will be providing the transport within Islamabad and Rawalpindi
            from selected points.</li>
        <li>Liaison Packages including our official invitation along with posters will be mailed to the ambassadors. They will display the posters at the most visited places in their institute to ensure maximum registrations. Ambassadors will receive packages
            on *add date*</li>
